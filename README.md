For example, lights, fans, or coffee makers can be programmed to turn on or off at specific times, ensuring energy efficiency and convenience. This feature is especially useful for home and office automation, where routine tasks can be managed effortlessly.

Voice Control The smart extension board supports integration with popular voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Siri. This allows users to control appliances using simple voice commands, making it a hands-free solution for smart homes and offices.
